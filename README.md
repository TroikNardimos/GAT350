## Introduction
This repository contains two projects: a **Software Renderer** and a **Ray Tracer**, both built from scratch in C++. These projects aim to provide an in-depth understanding of computer graphics by implementing key techniques such as shading, material handling, and post-processing without relying on hardware-accelerated APIs. The repository is an excellent resource for learning the fundamentals of rendering and ray tracing.

## Features
### Software Renderer
- **Triangle Rasterization**: Efficiently rasterizes triangles onto a 2D framebuffer.
- **Shader Support**: Implements basic and advanced shading models.
- **Lighting Techniques**: Supports both Gouraud and Phong shading.
- **Post-Processing**: Includes basic effects to enhance rendered images.

### Ray Tracer
- **Material Types**: Handles different materials like reflective, refractive, and diffuse surfaces.
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Improves image quality by reducing jagged edges.
- **Lighting Models**: Supports multiple light types for realistic illumination.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **SDL2**: For window and input management.
- **glm**: For mathematics operations (vectors and matrices).
- **C++ Compiler**: A modern compiler supporting C++17 or later.
- **Visual Studio** (or another IDE): Recommended for project setup and debugging.

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TroikNardimos/GAT350.git
   cd GAT350
   ```
2. Install dependencies (e.g., using a package manager like vcpkg):
   ```bash
   vcpkg install sdl2 glm
   ```
3. Open the project in Visual Studio:
   - Load the `.sln` file from the root directory.
   - Configure the build settings (Release/Debug) and target platform.
4. Build the project using Visual Studioâ€™s build system.

## Usage
### Software Renderer
Run the software renderer executable:
```bash
./2D
```
This project processes a set of triangles and applies rasterization, shading, and post-processing. Configuration options are defined in the source code.

### Ray Tracer
Run the ray tracer executable:
```bash
./RayTracer
```
Specify scene settings and material properties in the configuration file or source code to generate high-quality ray-traced images.

## Technical Details
### Shader Support
The software renderer includes programmable shaders for applying shading models like Gouraud and Phong. These shaders operate per-vertex or per-pixel to calculate lighting and color.

### Lighting Techniques
- **Gouraud Shading**: Computes lighting at vertices and interpolates across the triangle.
- **Phong Shading**: Computes lighting per-pixel for smoother and more realistic results.

### Material Types and Anti-Aliasing
The ray tracer supports:
- **Diffuse Materials**: For basic matte surfaces.
- **Reflective Materials**: Simulates mirror-like reflections.
- **Refractive Materials**: Handles light bending through transparent objects.
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Reduces aliasing artifacts by sampling multiple rays per pixel.
